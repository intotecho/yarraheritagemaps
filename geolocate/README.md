# Batch Geocoding with Python and Google Geocoding API

This repository contains a python script to geocode multiple addresses using the Google Geocoding API.

Addresses can be geocoded for free at a rate of 2500 addresses per day, limited by Google. With a Google Developer API key, any number of addresses can be geocoded.

Data input and output is processed from CSV files.

Also merges the geolocation data back in and fixes the column names.

Compatible with preemptible google shell.
